matters.  Would you be able to meet with me at Enron's office on either

Eurasia Group is pleased to announce a breakfast roundtable in the next in
our Eurasia Forum series:

TURKEY'S POLITICAL STABILITY with TANSU CILLER, FORMER TURKISH PRIME
MINISTER

Discussant: TBD

Chair: Ian Bremmer, President, Eurasia Group

DATE: Friday, 4 May 2001
TIME: 8:30am - 10:00am
PLACE: Eurasia Group Executive Offices
461 Fifth Avenue, 14th Floor (enter on 40th Street)
New York, NY  10017

A public row between the Turkish president and prime minister in
mid-February sparked market turmoil that resulted in an overnight 30%
devaluation in the lira and a crash of the IMF-backed stabilization program.
These events led to the resignations of the central bank governor and
treasury undersecretary and have tested the staying power of the country's
three-party government coalition.  In response to this instability, the
Turkish government appointed former World Bank Vice President, Kemal Dervis,
as the new Minister of Economics in hopes of resuscitating the country's
fledgling economy.

Ciller was elected Prime Minister in June 1993; her True Path party led
several coalition governments until 1996.  After losing her seat in 1996,
her party formed a coalition with the center-right Motherland Party which
was followed by an alliance with the conservative far-right Welfare Party.
The later move resulted in heightened tension between True Path and the
military and business establishment.  In the current financial turmoil, Ms.
Ciller has attempted to reposition herself as a force that will regain the
nation's financial and political stability.

eurasia group is pleased to announce a breakfast roundtable in the next in
our eurasia forum series:

turkey's political stability with tansu ciller, former turkish prime
minister

discussant: tbd

chair: ian bremmer, president, eurasia group

date: friday, 4 may 2001
time: 8:30am - 10:00am
place: eurasia group executive offices
461 fifth avenue, 14th floor (enter on 40th street)
new york, ny  10017

a public row between the turkish president and prime minister in
mid-february sparked market turmoil that resulted in an overnight 30%
devaluation in the lira and a crash of the imf-backed stabilization program.
these events led to the resignations of the central bank governor and
treasury undersecretary and have tested the staying power of the country's
three-party government coalition.  in response to this instability, the
turkish government appointed former world bank vice president, kemal dervis,
as the new minister of economics in hopes of resuscitating the country's
fledgling economy.

ciller was elected prime minister in june 1993; her true path party led
several coalition governments until 1996.  after losing her seat in 1996,
her party formed a coalition with the center-right motherland party which
was followed by an alliance with the conservative far-right welfare party.
the later move resulted in heightened tension between true path and the
military and business establishment.  in the current financial turmoil, ms.
ciller has attempted to reposition herself as a force that will regain the
nation's financial and political stability.

In a nutshell, an intelligent and bright achiever who can be of use to GA
in
many areas; global assets, EBS, and environmental come to mind very
clearly.
Her politeness, friendless, and actually openness,  indicate that she could
be a very good team player.   She perceives her  experience in Enron as
""very
positive"" and ""constructive""; she worked on contractual issues related to
Thermofloris, and Colombia-Panama Pipeline.

Risk Analytics is not her forte area, and a learning curve is needed.
However, her abilities-clearly from the resume and from the way she
explained
the details of her experience--indicate that this curve may not be a steep
one.  Actually, she would be a good addition to a well established Team in
Risk Analytics in the future when legal issues and their associated risks
are
dealt with.

I shall take the liberty to communicate with Amy again after she finishes
her

4369 E. Old Myers Rd.
Bloomington, IN 47408
pbothwel@indiana.edu

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from
selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such
as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's
employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to
low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy
bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California
consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's
employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy
and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical
profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there
are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills
and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock
while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.
Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of
those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Pauline Bothwell

Daren - thank you for the list of the true, remaining ENA sales customers.
I
have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that
Brenda
needs.  I am confused about Praxair though.

The sales contract between ENA & Praxair was assigned to HPLC eff/
10/1/99.
The only remaining contract between ENA & Praxair is a Master Financial
Agreement.

Does Praxair really need to remain under ENA or is it okay under HPLC?  If
it
really needs to be under ENA, we will need to un-do the 10/1/99 assignment
to
HPLC or set-up a new contract between ENA & Praxair.

Please advise.

Cheryl,

The counterparties with which ENA currently sales gas are:

City of Brazoria
Central Illinois Light Company
D & H Gas Company, Inc.
Markham Gas
Merit Energy Partners
Praxair
Reliant Energy - Entex
Reliant Energy - HL&P
Southern Union Company
Texas Utilities Fuel Company (Now TXU Fuel Co)
Union Carbide Corporation
Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc


ENA has transacted with the other companies listed below, but that will
most
likely not happen again.  (HPL will trade with those counterparties.)

All ENA trades on HPL will be in Sitara.  We have reports which can be
generated out of CPR that can list all deals by counterparty for ENA.  Let
me
know if you need something like that.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Subject: ENA Sales on HPL

I am working on a project for Brenda Herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if I'm on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking.

She is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA
&
HPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to
accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA
is
doing off of HPL's pipe.

I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell
Activity
on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will
this give me everything that I need?

Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up
in
Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the
gas
on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  --
?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara?

Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how
some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!

Thanks in advance.

subject: ena sales on hpl

i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i'm on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking.

she is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ena
&
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets.  in order to
accomplish this, she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena
is
doing off of hpl's pipe.

i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy/sell
activity
on hpl since 7/99.  if i eliminate the buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will
this give me everything that i need?

are there buy/sell deals done with ena on hpl's pipe that wouldn't show up
in
sitara?  someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the
gas
on it's own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot  --
?????  do deals like that happen? would they show up in sitara?

is there anything else that i'm missing?  i'm not real familiar with how
some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!

thanks in advance.
","last that i had, was that legal was reviewing the contract.  which sounds
like it has been forgotten.

cheryl:  i would ask dan hyvl to find out where legal stands on this.

daren - thank you for the list of the true, remaining ena sales customers.
i
have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that
brenda
needs.  i am confused about praxair though.

the sales contract between ena & praxair was assigned to hplc eff/
10/1/99.
the only remaining contract between ena & praxair is a master financial
agreement.

does praxair really need to remain under ena or is it okay under hplc?  if
it
really needs to be under ena, we will need to un-do the 10/1/99 assignment
to
hplc or set-up a new contract between ena & praxair.

please advise.

cheryl,

the counterparties with which ena currently sales gas are:

city of brazoria
central illinois light company
d & h gas company, inc.
markham gas
merit energy partners
praxair
reliant energy - entex
reliant energy - hl&p
southern union company
texas utilities fuel company (now txu fuel co)
union carbide corporation
unit gas transmission company inc


ena has transacted with the other companies listed below, but that will
most
likely not happen again.  (hpl will trade with those counterparties.)

all ena trades on hpl will be in sitara.  we have reports which can be
generated out of cpr that can list all deals by counterparty for ena.  let
me
know if you need something like that.

let me know if you have any other questions.

just to update you on this project's status:

based on a new report that scott mills ran for me from sitara, i have come
up
with the following counterparties as the ones to which ena is selling gas
off
of hpl's pipe.

altrade transaction, l.l.c.   gulf gas utilities company
brazoria, city of     panther pipeline, inc.
central illinois light company   praxair, inc.
central power and light company  reliant energy - entex
ces - equistar chemicals, lp   reliant energy - hl&p
central illinois light company  southern union company
d & h gas company, inc.   texas utilities fuel company
duke energy field services, inc.  txu gas distribution
entex gas marketing company   union carbide corporation
equistar chemicals, lp    unit gas transmission company inc.


since i'm not sure exactly what gets entered into sitara, pat clynes
suggested that i check with daren farmer to make sure that i'm not missing
something (which i did below).  while i am waiting for a response from him
and/or mary smith, i will begin gathering the contractual volumes under the
above contracts.

Kim,

I'm attaching a spreadsheet that details the regions and delivery points we
would like to have migrated over to the Global Facilities database for
UBS.  There are two separate tabs - one for regions and one for delivery
points.  I have left a message with John in Portland to call me in the
morning and I will have him compile the same information for you for the
west.

Please let me know if you have any questions!
Thanks!

Subject: GIR settlement

As you know, approximately one year ago Transwestern first learned of a
dark
cloud looming on the regulatory horizon in California.  The CPUC in its
draft
Order on the Gas Industry Restructuring proceeding in May, 1999 listed,
among
a variety of ""promising options,"" the institution of Mojave's ""Hector Road""
as a commercial receipt point into the SoCalGas system.  In fact, the CPUC
held in its ""Findings of Fact"" with regard to Hector Road that:

 - It is unlikely that the market will accurately reflect the value of
transmission resources if SoCalGas were to define its marketable
transmission
access in a way that did not include the Hector Road facilities, and

 - The failure to provide at least window-style access through Hector Road
has resulted in lost opportunities for bringing relatively inexpensive gas
into Southern California.

The basis for the CPUC finding came from testimony taken during the
proceeding indicating that the use of Hector Road displaces deliveries to
the
constrained delivery point at Wheeler Ridge.  In other words, whatever
could
be delivered by Mojave at Hector Road frees-up space at Wheeler Ridge, a
delivery point many in the marketplace considered more desirable.

As first articulated by SoCalGas in its draft settlement proposal in the
summer of 1999, the Hector Road point would be established as a formal
receipt point into SoCalGas, with rights equal to Transwestern's delivery
point at North Needles.  With a meter capacity of 200 MMcf/d, and with the
market's apparent interest in securing additional capacity at Hector Road,
Transwestern was facing the real possibility of losing up to 200 MMcf/d of
access rights into SoCalGas at North Needles.  Using an average transport
rate of $0.25/Mcf, the resulting loss in transport revenues would be $19MM
per year.

Through months of [seemingly endless] negotiations, and through an
educational process begun by Transwestern during one of the early
settlement
meetings back in September 1999, Transwestern went from a party with a
""bullseye"" clearly taped on its back, to a party that other stakeholders
were
depending on for a principled solution to these receipt point issues.  As
it
stands now, the Appendix A to the Settlement Agreement, ""Primary and
Secondary Receipt Point Access Rights"" is nearly identical to the
principles
outlined by Transwestern in that September settlement meeting.

I only re-state the obvious here to remind the group what their hard work
has
accomplished.  Not only am I proud to see that the resulting Settlement
Agreement filed with the CPUC today treats Transwestern and its shippers
equitably, but I'm proud that the work group we cobbled together for this
effort functioned like a ""well oiled machine.""

I thank each of you for your efforts to get to this point.  We know we've
still got a lot of work to do to gain CPUC approval of this document, but
no
matter what happens, we can be proud of what was accomplished here.

 - the failure to provide at least window-style access through hector road
has resulted in lost opportunities for bringing relatively inexpensive gas
into southern california.

the basis for the cpuc finding came from testimony taken during the
proceeding indicating that the use of hector road displaces deliveries to
the
constrained delivery point at wheeler ridge.  in other words, whatever
could
be delivered by mojave at hector road frees-up space at wheeler ridge, a
delivery point many in the marketplace considered more desirable.

as first articulated by socalgas in its draft settlement proposal in the
summer of 1999, the hector road point would be established as a formal
receipt point into socalgas, with rights equal to transwestern's delivery
point at north needles.  with a meter capacity of 200 mmcf/d, and with the
market's apparent interest in securing additional capacity at hector road,
transwestern was facing the real possibility of losing up to 200 mmcf/d of
access rights into socalgas at north needles.  using an average transport
rate of $0.25/mcf, the resulting loss in transport revenues would be $19mm
per year.

through months of [seemingly endless] negotiations, and through an
educational process begun by transwestern during one of the early
settlement
meetings back in september 1999, transwestern went from a party with a
""bullseye"" clearly taped on its back, to a party that other stakeholders
were
depending on for a principled solution to these receipt point issues.  as
it
stands now, the appendix a to the settlement agreement, ""primary and
secondary receipt point access rights"" is nearly identical to the
principles
outlined by transwestern in that september settlement meeting.

i only re-state the obvious here to remind the group what their hard work
has
accomplished.  not only am i proud to see that the resulting settlement
agreement filed with the cpuc today treats transwestern and its shippers
equitably, but i'm proud that the work group we cobbled together for this
effort functioned like a ""well oiled machine.""

i thank each of you for your efforts to get to this point.  we know we've
still got a lot of work to do to gain cpuc approval of this document, but
no
matter what happens, we can be proud of what was accomplished here.

subject: gir settlement

as you know, approximately one year ago transwestern first learned of a
dark
cloud looming on the regulatory horizon in california.  the cpuc in its
draft
order on the gas industry restructuring proceeding in may, 1999 listed,
among
a variety of ""promising options,"" the institution of mojave's ""hector road""
as a commercial receipt point into the socalgas system.  in fact, the cpuc
held in its ""findings of fact"" with regard to hector road that:

 - it is unlikely that the market will accurately reflect the value of
transmission resources if socalgas were to define its marketable
transmission
access in a way that did not include the hector road facilities, and

 - the failure to provide at least window-style access through hector road
has resulted in lost opportunities for bringing relatively inexpensive gas
into southern california.

the basis for the cpuc finding came from testimony taken during the
proceeding indicating that the use of hector road displaces deliveries to
the
constrained delivery point at wheeler ridge.  in other words, whatever
could

losing up to mmcf d of access rights into socalgas at north needles using an average transport rate of mcf the resulting loss in transport revenues would be mm per year through months of seemingly endless negotiations and through an educational process begun by transwestern during one of the early settlement meetings back in september transwestern went from a party with a bullseye clearly taped on its back to a party that other stakeholders were depending on for a principled solution to these receipt point issues as it stands now the appendix a to the settlement agreement primary and secondary receipt point access rights is nearly identical to the principles outlined by transwestern in that september settlement meeting i only re state the obvious here to remind the group what their hard work has accomplished not only am i proud to see that the resulting settlement agreement filed with the cpuc today treats transwestern and its shippers equitably but i m proud that the work group we cobbled together for this effort functioned like a well oiled machine i thank each of you for your efforts to get to this point we know we have still got a lot of work to do to gain cpuc approval of this document but no matter what happens we can be proud of what was accomplished here forwarded by jeffery fawcett et s enron on pm from susan scott pm to sullivan glen j cc mbd leslie

43,43,44,Laxmi Saoji <laxmi.saoji@gmail.com>,laxmi.saoji@gmail.com,2022-02-09,Greening the Enron Building Mtg,"Wanted to give you brief feedback on our efforts to become the 1st Fortune
500 Company that has a 100% green headquarters.  We've established a
company-wide team and a working plan going forward, which includes:

1.  EES commodity team is going to run the numbers for energy commodity for
facilities and give them a proposal by end of next week.  While facilities
will not be part of the TX pilot, EES can arrange a financial deal for them
w/ an option of going physical on 1/1/02.   EES commodity team will also
let
the group know of the offer, in order to structure the REC deal.  Depending
upon the savings that EES can offer to Facilities, we will determine any
""headroom"" for REC purchases.
Note: It is not necessary for Facilities to sign a commodity deal w/ EES in
order for the ""greening"" of the building to go forward.  The RECs can be
purchased and retired irrespective of the commodity deal with EES.
HOWEVER,
it would be optimum for Facilities to sign on w/ EES and use the cost
savings
toward purchase of the RECs.  Facilities stated intent to do the latter.
2. Michael Payne and Mike Curry are going to be working on determining a
cost
for the RECs.  Michael initially projected $250,000 per year for the
requisite number of RECs to retire commensurate w/ the demand of the
building.  This was at a cost of $8 per REC, which I believe is quite
high.
I think they'll go for a $1-4 dollar range, bringing the cost down to a max
of $125,000.  There's several ways to slice this end.  We can provide some
of
the RECs from the EWC facility and buy other RECs from the market in order
to
minimize the cost impact of the REC purchases.
3.  Next Thursday we will be able to get more of an exact figure on the
premium cost for the RECs (ie how much over the cost savings will the RECs
cost).  We will then need to decide the following:
 a. Would Corp/EHS being will to pitch in to cover any additional cost for
the RECs;
 b. Pitching the idea to Skilling for buyoff, and payment for the RECs;
 c. Possibly getting buyoff from the business units since this could change
what they are currently paying for power.
4. We discussed all of the above with Peggy Mahoney, and she asked us to
take
a stab at a comprehensive press release announcing all of the bells and
whistles on the new building and our being the 1st Fortune 500 company to
go
100% green in our headquarters.   Catherine McKalip Thompson is working on
the first draft.  We need to determine if we can get the ""best"" press for
this commitment (i.e. stories in the WSJ and NY Times).  We determined that
the message would need to be targeted, specifying the terms of our
commitment....i.e. Enron makes a commitment for 3 years to provide 100%
green
for its headquarters in Houston, making it the first Fortune 500 company
to.......

The goal is to have a final plan and decision by April 20th when Steve
speaks
to high level executives at a prelude to Earth Day NY on the topic of
Energy
Shock--Crisis or Opportunity: Building Economics and the Environment.

Mike, we'll definitely need your continued support and assistance,
particularly if this goes to Skilling.  I'll keep you posted on the
progress.

You are invited to a meeting next Thursday (3/22) afternoon at 2:00 to
discuss energy commodity and renewable energy credits for the Enron
Building,
Center and Stadium.  There are a few efforts that are going on
simultaneously
and I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the
same page.  As many of you might know, Enron Wind (Michael Payne) and ENA
(Mike Curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from
our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and
stadium
(details attached below).  If this proposal goes forward, Enron would be
the
1st Fortune 500 company to ""go green"" in its headquarters building.  Couple
this w/ our energy star award, and we have GREAT environmental messaging.
We'd like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day (April 22nd).

The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for
actual commodity.  It makes sense to work strategically together on win-win
proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in
our messaging.  The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various
proposals,
and steps for moving forward.

The meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 2:00-3:00. Please let me know if you or
someone from your group can attend.

",gmail,Gmail,"Wanted to give you brief feedback on our efforts to become the 1st Fortune
500 Company that has a 100% green headquarters.  We've established a
company-wide team and a working plan going forward, which includes:

1.  EES commodity team is going to run the numbers for energy commodity for
facilities and give them a proposal by end of next week.  While facilities
will not be part of the TX pilot, EES can arrange a financial deal for them
w/ an option of going physical on 1/1/02.   EES commodity team will also
let
the group know of the offer, in order to structure the REC deal.  Depending
upon the savings that EES can offer to Facilities, we will determine any
""headroom"" for REC purchases.
Note: It is not necessary for Facilities to sign a commodity deal w/ EES in
order for the ""greening"" of the building to go forward.  The RECs can be
purchased and retired irrespective of the commodity deal with EES.
HOWEVER,
it would be optimum for Facilities to sign on w/ EES and use the cost
savings
toward purchase of the RECs.  Facilities stated intent to do the latter.

subject: greening the enron building mtg

you are invited to a meeting next thursday (3/22) afternoon at 2:00 to
discuss energy commodity and renewable energy credits for the enron
building,
center and stadium.  there are a few efforts that are going on
simultaneously
and i thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the
same page.  as many of you might know, enron wind (michael payne) and ena
(mike curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from
our enron wind facility to match the consumption of the building and
stadium
(details attached below).  if this proposal goes forward, enron would be
the
1st fortune 500 company to ""go green"" in its headquarters building.  couple
this w/ our energy star award, and we have great environmental messaging.
we'd like to highlight this announcement on earth day (april 22nd).

the facilities folks are interested in switching from reliant to ees for
actual commodity.  it makes sense to work strategically together on win-win
proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in
our messaging.  the focus of the meeting is to discuss the various
proposals,
and steps for moving forward.

the meeting will be in eb50mo3 from 2:00-3:00. please let me know if you or
someone from your group can attend.

","wanted to give you brief feedback on our efforts to become the 1st fortune
500 company that has a 100% green headquarters.  we've established a
company-wide team and a working plan going forward, which includes:

1.  ees commodity team is going to run the numbers for energy commodity for
facilities and give them a proposal by end of next week.  while facilities
will not be part of the tx pilot, ees can arrange a financial deal for them
w/ an option of going physical on 1/1/02.   ees commodity team will also
let
the group know of the offer, in order to structure the rec deal.  depending
upon the savings that ees can offer to facilities, we will determine any
""headroom"" for rec purchases.
note: it is not necessary for facilities to sign a commodity deal w/ ees in
order for the ""greening"" of the building to go forward.  the recs can be
purchased and retired irrespective of the commodity deal with ees.
however,
it would be optimum for facilities to sign on w/ ees and use the cost
savings
toward purchase of the recs.  facilities stated intent to do the latter.
2. michael payne and mike curry are going to be working on determining a
cost
for the recs.  michael initially projected $250,000 per year for the
requisite number of recs to retire commensurate w/ the demand of the
building.  this was at a cost of $8 per rec, which i believe is quite
high.
i think they'll go for a $1-4 dollar range, bringing the cost down to a max
of $125,000.  there's several ways to slice this end.  we can provide some
of
the recs from the ewc facility and buy other recs from the market in order
to
minimize the cost impact of the rec purchases.
3.  next thursday we will be able to get more of an exact figure on the
premium cost for the recs (ie how much over the cost savings will the recs
cost).  we will then need to decide the following:
 a. would corp/ehs being will to pitch in to cover any additional cost for
the recs;
 b. pitching the idea to skilling for buyoff, and payment for the recs;
 c. possibly getting buyoff from the business units since this could change
what they are currently paying for power.
4. we discussed all of the above with peggy mahoney, and she asked us to
take
a stab at a comprehensive press release announcing all of the bells and
whistles on the new building and our being the 1st fortune 500 company to
go
100% green in our headquarters.   catherine mckalip thompson is working on
the first draft.  we need to determine if we can get the ""best"" press for
this commitment (i.e. stories in the wsj and ny times).  we determined that
the message would need to be targeted, specifying the terms of our
commitment....i.e. enron makes a commitment for 3 years to provide 100%
green
for its headquarters in houston, making it the first fortune 500 company
to.......

the goal is to have a final plan and decision by april 20th when steve
speaks
to high level executives at a prelude to earth day ny on the topic of
energy
shock--crisis or opportunity: building economics and the environment.

mike, we'll definitely need your continued support and assistance,
particularly if this goes to skilling.  i'll keep you posted on the
progress.

ees and use the cost savings toward purchase of the recs facilities stated intent to do the latter michael payne and mike curry are going to be working on determining a cost for the recs michael initially projected per year for the requisite number of recs to retire commensurate w the demand of the building this was at a cost of per rec which i believe is quite high i think they will go for a dollar range bringing the cost down to a max of there is several ways to slice this end we can provide some of the recs from the ewc facility and buy other recs from the market in order to minimize the cost impact of the rec purchases next thursday we will be able to get more of an exact figure on the premium cost for the recs ie how much over the cost savings will the recs cost we will then need to decide the following a would corp ehs being will to pitch in to cover any additional cost for the recs b pitching the idea to skilling for buyoff and payment for the recs c possibly getting buyoff from the business units since this could change what they are currently paying for power we discussed all of the above with peggy mahoney and she asked us to take a stab at a comprehensive press release announcing all of the bells and whistles on the new building and our being the st fortune company to go green in our headquarters catherine mckalip thompson is working on the first draft we need to determine if we can get the best press for this commitment i e stories in the wsj and ny times we determined that the message would need to be targeted specifying the terms of our commitment i e enron makes a commitment for years to provide green for its headquarters in houston making it the first fortune company to the goal is to have a final plan and decision by april th when

to match the consumption of the building and stadium details attached below if this proposal goes forward enron would be the st fortune company to go green in its headquarters building couple this w

44,44,45,Uttam Grade <uttamgrade@gmail.com>,laxmi.saoji@gmail.com,2022-02-09,hello from Charles Shen at Williams Co.,"Dear Vince:

How are you? I am not sure whether you still remember
me, we met in a conference last year in Houston. After
having been working for Williams for about two years,
now I am ready to make a move. I have heard Enron is a
great company, I am wondering whether there is any
opportunity for me, either in research group or in
structure group

Here is brief description about myself: Right after I
got my Ph.D. on finance and econometrics from Duke
University in 1998, I joined Williams Energy Trading
company as a Quantitative Analyst. Now I am Lead Quant
and in charge of the quantitative research group with
7 highly talented people. I have done extensive
research and modeling about electricity,
load-following deal and tolling deals.

If you need any additional information, please feel
free to call me at 918-409-4308. I look forward to
hearing from you soon, thank you.

sincerely,
Charles

complaint
form wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designed the
form is the same that hired there ticketing help.

-E

To whom it may concern:

I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was
wonderful
except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.

I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for
Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride
(the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the
flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because
of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for
this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of
the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no
danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which
leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was
less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline
(Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered
us
to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that
we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible
to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this
connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on
flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time.
It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my
vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.
I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we
missed
our connection we were forced to spend a combined
6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose,
CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead
of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten
hours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of
vacation.  Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again
because of this experience.

For your research I provide the following data:
Persons in Party - Eric Bass, Larry Bass, Kathy Bass, Jason Bass, Shanna
Husser, and Donnita Franklin.

56,56,57,Laxmi Saoji <laxmi.saoji@gmail.com>,laxmi.saoji@gmail.com,2022-02-09,Off-site: John Griebling's organization and Research Group,"Jeff,

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's
organization
and the Research Group.

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado


As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish
transfer
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project
in the future.

We are also inviting to this off-site senior management of EBS and plan to
have
on the agenda several presentations about strategic directions of EBS. The
effort
of network design and construction currently under way is  unprecedented in
terms
of its scope and complexity and it is important  for technical people, who
often have
highly specialized technical skills, to understand the broad picture.

I would appreciate if you could join us for Friday afternoon (April 28) and
Saturday (April 29). I understand  that you have commitments on Thursday

",gmail,Gmail,"Jeff,

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's
organization
and the Research Group.

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado


As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish
transfer
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project
in the future.

We are also inviting to this off-site senior management of EBS and plan to
have
on the agenda several presentations about strategic directions of EBS. The
effort
of network design and construction currently under way is  unprecedented in
terms
of its scope and complexity and it is important  for technical people, who
often have
highly specialized technical skills, to understand the broad picture.

I would appreciate if you could join us for Friday afternoon (April 28) and
Saturday (April 29). I understand  that you have commitments on Thursday
and
Friday
morning. We have reorganized the tentative agenda of the meeting to devote
Friday afternoon to more general topics.

someone I feel even more for than Ted (at least that's what I'm focusing
on).  So do we know if Pat Fitzgerald is single?

Anyway, I've found I'm not that attracted to cowards (which is exactly the
catagory I'd put Ted in right now).

Hope everything's good with you (especially the firm recruiting).  I'm
coming
up this weekend for the game - hopefully Friday night - and wanted to see
if
you and Doug wanted to go out either Friday night or after the game
Saturday.  I hope you guys are planning on going to the game because I'd
love
to sit with you.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

PS - Check out the list of individuals for our girls night out the
Thurs...I
don't think I'm going to go (I don't have enough time to waste on people
I'm
not that fond of)

Rumors of Eni / Enron Merger Abound, Despite Denials from Eni
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Eni, the Italian oil and gas group, is expected to complete the sale of
its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus
on its core activities of natural-gas and oil production. Vittorio Mincato,
Eni's chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizi=
ng
the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary (Eni's real
estate company) with assets valued between $856 million and $1.3 billion.
Eni's decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observ=
ers
of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with
another company. Enron Corp. has been among those on a rumored short list
of merger prospects for Eni.

ANALYSIS: Is the foundation being established for a mega-merger between
Eni and Enron? It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument
in that direction.

Eni is Italy's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating in
the oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, and
engineering industries. The company has a market capitalization of about
47 billion euros (approximately $40 billion), is present in over 70 countri=
es
and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Across
the European energy market=01*which once it has fully privatized will repre=
sent
an arguably larger market than the United States=01*Eni is unquestionably
one of the Continent's leading champions.

Illustrating this point, Eni has taken several important steps within Europ=
e
to, as it says, ""play an increasingly important role"" in the Continent's
competitive energy market. For instance, earlier this month, Eni inked
a deal to sell 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France.
This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell 4 billi=
on
cubic meters of natural gas to Italy's largest private energy supplier,
Edison. With both agreements, Eni has given a substantial kick start to
the opening of the European natural-gas market. CEO Mincato has said that
Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy
by ""focusing on international markets.""

One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month.
Eni made a bid for Australia's Petroz NL, which wields an 8.25 percent
stake in Bayu-Undan, the giant gas and liquids project located off the
northern coast of Australia. Eni already owns 6.7 percent of Bayu-Undan
and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project.
It is no wonder why=01*the Bayu-Undan field has recoverable reserves of 400
million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trillion
cubic feet. Petroz has not yet accepted Eni's offer, but a favorable decisi=
on
is expected shortly. Thus, whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is
trying to regain in other key areas of the world. In fact, Mincato recently
confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current
level of 1.2 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels by 2003.

Moreover, Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion, both within
Europe and beyond. Along with that expansion comes the development of merge=
r
strategy. Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover, which
could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact
that its profits remain strong. Net income for the company for the first
half of 2000 was 2,606 millions of euros (equivalent to approximately $2.2
billion), representing a 119-percent increase. Eni is largely considered
one of the best buys among the big oil stocks, but it would rather merge
with an equal partner than be sold to another company. As consolidation
of the oil industry continues, Eni reportedly believes that the only way
to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world
stage.

Enron may be at the top of Eni's list of merger partners. Negotiations
with Spain's largest oil company, Repsol, appear to have stalled, as was
confirmed when Mincato stated that any ""link-up with Repsol would not be
a merger of equals."" French oil company TotalFina is also interested, but
is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf.
Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips=20
Petroleum.
It is quite obvious that Eni's merger prospects are predominantly oil=20
companies,
which is quite clearly the company's intention. Thus, it may seem odd that
Enron is also included as a top prospect. Enron, while unquestionably a
world player, is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets. Put
succinctly, Enron believes that it doesn't need to own physical assets
in order to be a major player, but rather it only needs to rely on strategi=
c
contractual agreements.

However, if Eni wants to continue to expand globally, it arguably could
not find a better partner than Enron, generally considered North America's
biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas. Enron's gas tradin=
g
and distribution activities in particular=01*along with its electricity=20
production,
raw material trading and broadband expansion=01*would all appear to be good
compliments to Eni's portfolio. Reports of talks between the two companies
first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole 24 Ore, based on
input from an unnamed source. The report indicated that Enron is being
targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger. Mincato,
as recently as Tuesday of this week, continues to adamantly deny that any
deal with Enron is being studied.

Not surprisingly, Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even
mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures. However, the incorporation of
Eni's power production portfolio would support Enron's expansion into new
markets such as Japan, for example. Back in March, the Japanese government
began allowing non-utility firms to supply power to industrial and commerci=
al
end-users. Almost simultaneously, Enron established a new subsidiary, Enron
Japan Corp., to capitalize on new opportunities in the country. Enron Japan=
's
first offer is a 10-percent discount off current electricity prices for
customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years. Operating against
its North American strategy, Enron also plans to build a power station
in northern Japan, beating to the punch several of its key rivals, includin=
g
Vivendi, Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell, which also have expressed interest
in establishing operations in the country.

Enron's proposed power plant should give the company prime access to compan=
ies
in the Tohoku and Kanto regions, as well as Tokyo, the ""big catch"" of the
Japanese market. In my opinion, herein lies the primary synergy that would
make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both=20
companies.
As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets, Japan seems
like a natural location, and I've seen no reports that indicate Eni is
moving into Japan on its own. The fact that Enron is already there, along
with most other lucrative international markets, must certainly be appealin=
g
to Eni. Regarding Enron's perspective on any potential partnering, Eni's
substantial oil and natural-gas generation assets, along with its current
lock on the European market, must be very attractive.

Enron's current market capitalization is about $48 billion, which actually
makes it larger than Eni. This raises the question of which company would
be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place. All of the
rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron, but it could
just as easily be the other way around. Those of us who follow Enron closel=
y
may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the
target for a takeover or even a merger. In any case, the rumors continue
to fly as Eni responds to claims of ""thou doth protest too much."" Whether
or not any such merger between Eni and Enron, which appears smart on paper,
will materialize remains to be seen. However, it certainly seems like Eni
is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the
very near future.

Rumors of Eni / Enron Merger Abound, Despite Denials from Eni
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Eni, the Italian oil and gas group, is expected to complete the sale of
its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus
on its core activities of natural-gas and oil production. Vittorio Mincato,
Eni's chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizi=
ng
the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary (Eni's real
estate company) with assets valued between $856 million and $1.3 billion.
Eni's decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observ=
ers
of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with
another company. Enron Corp. has been among those on a rumored short list
of merger prospects for Eni.

ANALYSIS: Is the foundation being established for a mega-merger between
Eni and Enron? It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument
in that direction.

Eni is Italy's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating in
the oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, and
engineering industries. The company has a market capitalization of about
47 billion euros (approximately $40 billion), is present in over 70 countri=
es
and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Across
the European energy market=01*which once it has fully privatized will repre=
sent
an arguably larger market than the United States=01*Eni is unquestionably
one of the Continent's leading champions.

Illustrating this point, Eni has taken several important steps within Europ=
e
to, as it says, ""play an increasingly important role"" in the Continent's
competitive energy market. For instance, earlier this month, Eni inked
a deal to sell 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France.
This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell 4 billi=
on
cubic meters of natural gas to Italy's largest private energy supplier,
Edison. With both agreements, Eni has given a substantial kick start to
the opening of the European natural-gas market. CEO Mincato has said that
Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy
by ""focusing on international markets.""

One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month.
Eni made a bid for Australia's Petroz NL, which wields an 8.25 percent
stake in Bayu-Undan, the giant gas and liquids project located off the
northern coast of Australia. Eni already owns 6.7 percent of Bayu-Undan
and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project.
It is no wonder why=01*the Bayu-Undan field has recoverable reserves of 400
million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trillion
cubic feet. Petroz has not yet accepted Eni's offer, but a favorable decisi=
on
is expected shortly. Thus, whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is
trying to regain in other key areas of the world. In fact, Mincato recently
confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current
level of 1.2 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels by 2003.

Moreover, Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion, both within
Europe and beyond. Along with that expansion comes the development of merge=
r
strategy. Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover, which
could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact
that its profits remain strong. Net income for the company for the first
half of 2000 was 2,606 millions of euros (equivalent to approximately $2.2
billion), representing a 119-percent increase. Eni is largely considered
one of the best buys among the big oil stocks, but it would rather merge
with an equal partner than be sold to another company. As consolidation
of the oil industry continues, Eni reportedly believes that the only way
to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world
stage.

Enron may be at the top of Eni's list of merger partners. Negotiations
with Spain's largest oil company, Repsol, appear to have stalled, as was
confirmed when Mincato stated that any ""link-up with Repsol would not be
a merger of equals."" French oil company TotalFina is also interested, but
is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf.
Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips=20
Petroleum.
It is quite obvious that Eni's merger prospects are predominantly oil=20
companies,
which is quite clearly the company's intention. Thus, it may seem odd that
Enron is also included as a top prospect. Enron, while unquestionably a
world player, is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets. Put
succinctly, Enron believes that it doesn't need to own physical assets
in order to be a major player, but rather it only needs to rely on strategi=
c
contractual agreements.

However, if Eni wants to continue to expand globally, it arguably could
not find a better partner than Enron, generally considered North America's
biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas. Enron's gas tradin=
g
and distribution activities in particular=01*along with its electricity=20
production,
raw material trading and broadband expansion=01*would all appear to be good
compliments to Eni's portfolio. Reports of talks between the two companies
first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole 24 Ore, based on
input from an unnamed source. The report indicated that Enron is being
targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger. Mincato,
as recently as Tuesday of this week, continues to adamantly deny that any
deal with Enron is being studied.

Not surprisingly, Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even
mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures. However, the incorporation of
Eni's power production portfolio would support Enron's expansion into new
markets such as Japan, for example. Back in March, the Japanese government
began allowing non-utility firms to supply power to industrial and commerci=
al
end-users. Almost simultaneously, Enron established a new subsidiary, Enron
Japan Corp., to capitalize on new opportunities in the country. Enron Japan=
's
first offer is a 10-percent discount off current electricity prices for
customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years. Operating against
its North American strategy, Enron also plans to build a power station
in northern Japan, beating to the punch several of its key rivals, includin=
g
Vivendi, Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell, which also have expressed interest
in establishing operations in the country.

Enron's proposed power plant should give the company prime access to compan=
ies
in the Tohoku and Kanto regions, as well as Tokyo, the ""big catch"" of the
Japanese market. In my opinion, herein lies the primary synergy that would
make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both=20
companies.
As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets, Japan seems
like a natural location, and I've seen no reports that indicate Eni is
moving into Japan on its own. The fact that Enron is already there, along
with most other lucrative international markets, must certainly be appealin=
g
to Eni. Regarding Enron's perspective on any potential partnering, Eni's
substantial oil and natural-gas generation assets, along with its current
lock on the European market, must be very attractive.

Enron's current market capitalization is about $48 billion, which actually
makes it larger than Eni. This raises the question of which company would
be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place. All of the
rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron, but it could
just as easily be the other way around. Those of us who follow Enron closel=
y
may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the
target for a takeover or even a merger. In any case, the rumors continue
to fly as Eni responds to claims of ""thou doth protest too much."" Whether
or not any such merger between Eni and Enron, which appears smart on paper,
will materialize remains to be seen. However, it certainly seems like Eni
is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the
very near future.

rumors of eni / enron merger abound, despite denials from eni
by: will mcnamara, director, electric industry analysis

eni, the italian oil and gas group, is expected to complete the sale of
its italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus
on its core activities of natural-gas and oil production. vittorio mincato,
eni's chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizi=
ng
the sale of its immobiliare metanopoli property subsidiary (eni's real
estate company) with assets valued between $856 million and $1.3 billion.
eni's decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observ=
ers
of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with
another company. enron corp. has been among those on a rumored short list
of merger prospects for eni.

analysis: is the foundation being established for a mega-merger between
eni and enron? it is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument
in that direction.

eni is italy's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating in
the oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, and
engineering industries. the company has a market capitalization of about
47 billion euros (approximately $40 billion), is present in over 70 countri=
es
and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day. across
the european energy market=01*which once it has fully privatized will repre=
sent
an arguably larger market than the united states=01*eni is unquestionably
one of the continent's leading champions.

illustrating this point, eni has taken several important steps within europ=
e
to, as it says, ""play an increasingly important role"" in the continent's
competitive energy market. for instance, earlier this month, eni inked
a deal to sell 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to gaz de france.
this deal followed a previous agreement in which eni agreed to sell 4 billi=
on
cubic meters of natural gas to italy's largest private energy supplier,
edison. with both agreements, eni has given a substantial kick start to
the opening of the european natural-gas market. ceo mincato has said that
eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in italy
by ""focusing on international markets.""

one move that eni has made outside of europe also came earlier this month.
eni made a bid for australia's petroz nl, which wields an 8.25 percent
stake in bayu-undan, the giant gas and liquids project located off the
northern coast of australia. eni already owns 6.7 percent of bayu-undan
and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project.
it is no wonder why=01*the bayu-undan field has recoverable reserves of 400
million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trillion
cubic feet. petroz has not yet accepted eni's offer, but a favorable decisi=
on
is expected shortly. thus, whatever eni may be divesting in italy it is
trying to regain in other key areas of the world. in fact, mincato recently
confirmed that eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current
level of 1.2 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels by 2003.

moreover, eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion, both within
europe and beyond. along with that expansion comes the development of merge=
r
strategy. eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover, which
could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact
that its profits remain strong. net income for the company for the first
half of 2000 was 2,606 millions of euros (equivalent to approximately $2.2
billion), representing a 119-percent increase. eni is largely considered
one of the best buys among the big oil stocks, but it would rather merge
with an equal partner than be sold to another company. as consolidation
of the oil industry continues, eni reportedly believes that the only way
to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world
stage.

enron may be at the top of eni's list of merger partners. negotiations
with spain's largest oil company, repsol, appear to have stalled, as was
confirmed when mincato stated that any ""link-up with repsol would not be
a merger of equals."" french oil company totalfina is also interested, but
is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow french oil company elf.
other companies that have been mentioned include conoco and phillips=20
petroleum.
it is quite obvious that eni's merger prospects are predominantly oil=20
companies,
which is quite clearly the company's intention. thus, it may seem odd that
enron is also included as a top prospect. enron, while unquestionably a
world player, is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets. put
succinctly, enron believes that it doesn't need to own physical assets
in order to be a major player, but rather it only needs to rely on strategi=
c
contractual agreements.

however, if eni wants to continue to expand globally, it arguably could
not find a better partner than enron, generally considered north america's
biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas. enron's gas tradin=
g
and distribution activities in particular=01*along with its electricity=20
production,
raw material trading and broadband expansion=01*would all appear to be good
compliments to eni's portfolio. reports of talks between the two companies
first appeared in the italian financial paper il sole 24 ore, based on
input from an unnamed source. the report indicated that enron is being
targeted by eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger. mincato,
as recently as tuesday of this week, continues to adamantly deny that any
deal with enron is being studied.

not surprisingly, enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even
mentioned eni in any recent disclosures. however, the incorporation of
eni's power production portfolio would support enron's expansion into new
markets such as japan, for example. back in march, the japanese government
began allowing non-utility firms to supply power to industrial and commerci=
al
end-users. almost simultaneously, enron established a new subsidiary, enron
japan corp., to capitalize on new opportunities in the country. enron japan=
's
first offer is a 10-percent discount off current electricity prices for
customers who sign on with enron for two to four years. operating against
its north american strategy, enron also plans to build a power station
in northern japan, beating to the punch several of its key rivals, includin=
g
vivendi, texaco and royal dutch shell, which also have expressed interest
in establishing operations in the country.

enron's proposed power plant should give the company prime access to compan=
ies
in the tohoku and kanto regions, as well as tokyo, the ""big catch"" of the
japanese market. in my opinion, herein lies the primary synergy that would
make the partnership between eni and enron a strategic step for both=20
companies.
as eni attempts to position itself in various key markets, japan seems
like a natural location, and i've seen no reports that indicate eni is
moving into japan on its own. the fact that enron is already there, along
with most other lucrative international markets, must certainly be appealin=
g
to eni. regarding enron's perspective on any potential partnering, eni's
substantial oil and natural-gas generation assets, along with its current
lock on the european market, must be very attractive.

enron's current market capitalization is about $48 billion, which actually
makes it larger than eni. this raises the question of which company would
be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place. all of the
rumors flying around currently speak of eni pursuing enron, but it could
just as easily be the other way around. those of us who follow enron closel=
y
may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the
target for a takeover or even a merger. in any case, the rumors continue
to fly as eni responds to claims of ""thou doth protest too much."" whether
or not any such merger between eni and enron, which appears smart on paper,
will materialize remains to be seen. however, it certainly seems like eni
is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the
very near future.

denials from eni by: will mcnamara, director, electric industry analysis =3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=

property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus on its core activities of natural-gas and oil production. vittorio mincato, eni's chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizi= ng the sale of its immobiliare metanopoli property subsidiary (eni's real estate company) with assets valued between $856 million and $1.3 billion. eni's decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observ= ers of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with another company. enron corp. has been among those on a rumored short list of merger prospects for eni. analysis: is the foundation being established for a mega-merger between eni and enron? it is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument in that direction. eni is italy's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating in the oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, and engineering industries. the company has a market capitalization of about 47 billion euros (approximately $40 billion), is present in over 70 countri= es and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day. across the european energy market=01*which once it has fully privatized will repre= sent an arguably larger market than the united states=01*eni is unquestionably one of the continent's leading champions. illustrating this point, eni has taken several important steps within europ= e to, as it says, ""play an increasingly important role"" in the continent's competitive energy market. for instance, earlier this month, eni inked a deal to sell 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to gaz de france. this deal followed a previous agreement in which eni agreed to sell 4 billi= on cubic meters of natural gas to italy's largest private energy supplier, edison. with both agreements, eni has given a substantial kick start to the opening of the european natural-gas market. ceo mincato has said that eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in italy by ""focusing on international markets."" one move that eni has made outside of europe also came earlier this month. eni made a bid for australia's petroz nl, which wields an 8.25 percent stake in bayu-undan, the giant gas and liquids project located off the northern coast of australia. eni already owns 6.7 percent of bayu-undan and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project. it is no wonder why=01*the bayu-undan field has recoverable reserves of 400 million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trillion cubic feet. petroz has not yet accepted eni's offer, but a favorable decisi= on is expected shortly. thus, whatever eni may be divesting in italy it is trying to regain in other key areas of the world. in fact, mincato recently confirmed that eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current level of 1.2 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels by 2003. moreover, eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion, both within europe and beyond. along with that expansion comes the development of merge= r strategy. eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover, which could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact that its profits remain strong. net income for the company for the first half of 2000 was 2,606 millions of euros (equivalent to approximately $2.2 billion), representing a 119-percent increase. eni is largely considered one of the best buys among the big oil stocks, but it would rather merge with an equal partner than be sold to another company. as consolidation of the oil industry continues, eni reportedly believes that the only way to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world stage. enron may be at the top of eni's list of merger partners. negotiations with spain's largest oil company, repsol, appear to have stalled, as was confirmed when mincato stated that any ""link-up with repsol would not be a merger of equals."" french oil company totalfina is also interested, but is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow french oil company elf. other companies that have been mentioned include conoco and phillips=20 petroleum. it is quite obvious that eni's merger prospects are predominantly oil=20 companies, which is quite clearly the company's intention. thus, it may seem odd that enron is also included as a top prospect. enron, while unquestionably a world player, is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets. put succinctly, enron believes that it does not need to own physical assets in order to be a major player, but rather it only needs to rely on strategi= c contractual agreements. however, if eni wants to continue to expand globally, it arguably could not find a better partner than enron, generally considered north america's biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas. enron's gas tradin= g and distribution activities in particular=01*along with its electricity=20 production, raw material trading and broadband expansion=01*would all appear to be good compliments to eni's portfolio. reports of talks between the two companies first appeared in the italian financial paper il sole 24 ore, based on input from an unnamed source. the report indicated that enron is being targeted by eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger. mincato, as recently as tuesday of this week, continues to adamantly deny that any deal with enron is being studied. not surprisingly, enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even mentioned eni in any recent disclosures. however, the incorporation of eni's power production portfolio would support enron's expansion into new markets such as japan, for example. back in march, the japanese government began allowing non-utility firms to supply power to industrial and commerci= al end-users. almost simultaneously, enron established a new subsidiary, enron japan corp., to capitalize on new opportunities in the country. enron japan= 's first offer is a 10-percent discount off current electricity prices for customers who sign on with enron for two to four years. operating against its north american strategy, enron also plans to build a power station in northern japan, beating to the punch several of its key rivals, includin= g vivendi, texaco and royal dutch she will, which also have expressed interest in establishing operations in the country. enron's proposed power plant should give the company prime access to compan= ies in the tohoku and kanto regions, as well as tokyo, the ""big catch"" of the japanese market. in my opinion, herein lies the primary synergy that would make the partnership between eni and enron a strategic step for both=20 companies. as eni attempts to position itself in various key markets, japan seems like a natural location, and i've seen no reports that indicate eni is moving into japan on its own. the fact that enron is already there, along with most other lucrative international markets, must certainly be appealin= g to eni. regarding enron's perspective on any potential partnering, eni's substantial oil and natural-gas generation assets, along with its current lock on the european market, must be very attractive. enron's current market capitalization is about $48 billion, which actually makes it larger than eni. this raises the question of which company would be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place. all of the rumors flying around currently speak of eni pursuing enron, but it could just as easily be the other way around. those of us who follow enron closel= y may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the target for a takeover or even a merger. in any case, the rumors continue to fly as eni responds to claims of ""thou doth protest too much."" whether or not any such merger between eni and enron, which appears smart on paper, will materialize remains to be seen. however, it certainly seems like eni is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the very near future.

of natural gas and oil production  vittorio mincato  eni s chief executive  confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizi  ng the sale of its immobiliare metanopoli property subsidiary  eni s real estate company  with assets valued between  856 million and  1 3 billion  eni s decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observ  ers of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with another company  enron corp  has been among those on a rumored short list of merger prospects for eni  analysis  is the foundation being established for a mega merger between eni and enron  it is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument in that direction  eni is italy s state owned  multi faceted energy company  operating in the oil and gas  power

es and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day  across the european energy market 01 which once it has fully privatized will repre  sent an arguably larger market than the united states 01 eni is unquestionably one of the continent s leading champions  illustrating this point  eni has taken several important steps within europ  e to  as it says   play an increasingly important role  in the continent s competitive energy market  for instance  earlier this month  eni inked a deal to sell 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to gaz de france  this deal followed a previous agreement in which eni agreed to sell 4 billi  on cubic meters of natural gas to italy s largest private energy supplier  edison  with both agreements  eni has given a substantial kick start to the opening of the european natural gas market  ceo mincato has said that eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in italy by  focusing on international markets   one move that eni has made outside of europe also came earlier this month  eni made a bid for australia s petroz nl  which wields an 8 25 percent stake in bayu undan  the giant gas and liquids project located off the northern coast of australia  eni already owns 6 7 percent of bayu undan and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project  it is no wonder why 01 the bayu undan field has recoverable reserves of 400 million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3 4 trillion cubic feet  petroz has not yet accepted eni s offer  but a favorable decisi  on is expected shortly  thus  whatever eni may be divesting in italy it is trying to regain in other key areas of the world  in fact  mincato recently confirmed that eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current level of 1 2 million barrels to 1 5 million barrels by 2003  moreover  eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion  both within europe and beyond  along with that expansion comes the development of merge  r strategy  eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover  which could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact that its profits remain strong  net income for the company for the first half of 2000 was 2 606 millions of euros  equivalent to approximately  2 2 billion   representing a 119 percent increase  eni is largely considered one of the best buys among the big oil stocks  but it would rather merge with an equal partner than be sold to another company  as consolidation of the oil industry continues  eni reportedly believes that the only way to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world stage  enron may be at the top of eni s list of merger partners  negotiations with spain s largest oil company  repsol  appear to have stalled  as was confirmed when mincato stated that any  link up with repsol would not be a merger of equals   french oil company totalfina is also interested  but is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow french oil company elf  other companies that have been mentioned include conoco and phillips 20 petroleum  it is quite obvious that eni s merger prospects are predominantly oil 20 companies  which is quite clearly the company s intention  thus  it may seem odd that enron is also included as a top prospect  enron  while unquestionably a world player  is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets  put succinctly  enron believes that it does not need to own physical assets in order to be a major player  but rather it only needs to rely on strategi  c contractual agreements  however  if eni wants to continue to expand globally  it arguably could not find a better partner than enron  generally considered north america s biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas  enron s gas tradin  g and distribution activities in particular 01 along with its electricity 20 production  raw material trading and broadband expansion 01 would all appear to be good compliments to eni s portfolio  reports of talks between the two companies first appeared in the italian financial paper il sole 24 ore  based on input from an unnamed source  the report indicated that enron is being targeted by eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger  mincato  as recently as tuesday of this week  continues to adamantly deny that any deal with enron is being studied  not surprisingly  enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even mentioned eni in any recent disclosures  however  the incorporation of eni s power production portfolio would support enron s expansion into new markets such as japan  for example  back in march  the japanese government began allowing non utility firms to supply power to industrial and commerci  al end users  almost simultaneously  enron established a new subsidiary  enron japan corp   to capitalize on new opportunities in the country  enron japan   s first offer is a 10 percent discount off current electricity prices for customers who sign on with enron for two to four years  operating against its north american strategy  enron also plans to build a power station in northern japan  beating to the punch several of its key rivals  includin  g vivendi  texaco and royal dutch she will  which also have expressed interest in establishing operations in the country  enron s proposed power plant should give the company prime access to compan  ies in the tohoku and kanto regions  as well as tokyo  the  big catch  of the japanese market  in my opinion  herein lies the primary synergy that would make the partnership between eni and enron a strategic step for both 20 companies  as eni attempts to position itself in various key markets  japan seems like a natural location  and i ve seen no reports that indicate eni is moving into japan on its own  the fact that enron is already there  along with most other lucrative international markets  must certainly be appealin  g to eni  regarding enron s perspective on any potential partnering  eni s substantial oil and natural gas generation assets  along with its current lock on the european market  must be very attractive  enron s current market capitalization is about  48 billion  which actually makes it larger than eni  this raises the question of which company would be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place  all of the rumors flying around currently speak of eni pursuing enron  but it could just as easily be the other way around  those of us who follow enron closel  y may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the target for a takeover or even a merger  in any case  the rumors continue to fly as eni responds to claims of  thou doth protest too much   whether or not any such merger between eni and enron  which appears smart on paper  will materialize remains to be seen  however  it certainly seems like eni is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the very near future   3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d   3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d 3d

japan seems like a natural location and i ve seen no reports that indicate eni is moving into japan on its own the fact that enron is already there along with most other lucrative international markets must certainly be appealin g to eni regarding enron s perspective on any potential partnering eni s substantial oil and natural gas generation assets along with its current lock on the european market must be very attractive enron s current market capitalization is about billion which actually makes it larger than eni this raises the question of which company would be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place all of the rumors flying around currently speak of eni pursuing enron but it could just as easily be the other way around those of us who follow enron closel y may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the target for a takeover or even a merger in any case the rumors continue to fly as eni responds to claims of thou doth protest too much whether or not any such merger between eni and enron which appears smart on paper will materialize remains to be seen however it certainly seems like eni is lining up its chess pieces

Pelt,

We have made reservations for Fri. and Sat,  I didn't make yours but i
would move quickly.  Would you like me to set up a tee time and massages
for the girls?  I figured a 1 pm tee time?  Also what about tickets for the
game itself.  Will you have access as years gone by or does the search need
to begin?

you already made reservations and a tee time?  Who else is included in

We definitely are planning to go to Texas - O.U.  We are considering
staying
at the Four Seasons at Los Colinas.  Possibly a little golf and R & R mixed
in with the game.  It would be a bit out of the way.  We might go up as
early as Friday morning to play golf that afternoon.  Let me know what you
think.

Jonny,

Thank you so much for the email and kind words.  I was very moved by it and
you know I feel the same way.  I have become very reflective with the more
""success"" that I have been fortunate enough to receive.  I am so thankful
and appreciative and although I have always been religious and spiritual,
it has grown more deeply.  I see so many people that have lost their
perspective and I pray that I will remain grounded and truly appreciate the
blessings that our family has received.  Chris and I often discuss how we
can help others and what can we do to really make a difference.

The Jones and the McConnells are truly very lucky.   Thanks, and give my
love to your family.

Mike


PS:  What about OU - Texas, do you have any ideas or plans already in the
works?

Sometimes we fail to stop and reflect on events which are of significance
because we are so busy with our heads down accomplishing the things we
strive for.  I hope you are taking a moment to reflect and enjoy the
incredible accomplishments which you have achieved at such a young age.
You

to give back what we have been so fortunate to receive.

Congratulations and keep up the good work.  I am proud to call you my

You

Pelt,

We have made reservations for Fri. and Sat,  I didn't make yours but i
would move quickly.  Would you like me to set up a tee time and massages
for the girls?  I figured a 1 pm tee time?  Also what about tickets for the
game itself.  Will you have access as years gone by or does the search need
to begin?

Pup,

That sounds great to us.  I take it you are not bringing the kids.  Have
you already made reservations and a tee time?  Who else is included in
this?  Also, am i interfering by inviting ourselves in your plans!

We definitely are planning to go to Texas - O.U.  We are considering
staying
at the Four Seasons at Los Colinas.  Possibly a little golf and R & R mixed
in with the game.  It would be a bit out of the way.  We might go up as
early as Friday morning to play golf that afternoon.  Let me know what you
think.

Jonny,

Thank you so much for the email and kind words.  I was very moved by it and
you know I feel the same way.  I have become very reflective with the more
""success"" that I have been fortunate enough to receive.  I am so thankful
and appreciative and although I have always been religious and spiritual,
it has grown more deeply.  I see so many people that have lost their
perspective and I pray that I will remain grounded and truly appreciate the
blessings that our family has received.  Chris and I often discuss how we
can help others and what can we do to really make a difference.

The Jones and the McConnells are truly very lucky.   Thanks, and give my
love to your family.

Mike


PS:  What about OU - Texas, do you have any ideas or plans already in the
works?
