Firstly I was overcharged when I signed up, I signed up mid-month and was charged full price, this was only amended after I complained and there were constant issues related to the billing of my account - for a month to month contract I selected to pay automatically as there are rather ridiculous late payment penalties and administration fees for payment through other methods.     

DO NOT TRUST THIS MAN WITH YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION - I would seriously caution anyone from giving this man a credit card or debit card. There is ZERO accountability on his end and he will continue to bill your card even after you have terminated your month-to-month contract. 

Al is not customer focused and borders on being a bully when him and a customer disagree.  He never, after multiple requests showed me a summary of my billing and refused to honor my cancellation as it was not done so in person (though the contract states it can be terminated in writing).

I quit in November 2011 because i just had enough. Machines were always broken, showers were never clean and the curtains were always being ripped down due to the creepers who like to take a shower for hours. I worked out at 5am and there was always 30-50 people waiting to get in but they would not open any earlier. complaints to management never seemed to get me anywhere.

THEY ARE NOT PARENT FRIENDLY!!! NOT FEMALE FRIENDLY!!! 

There are NO FEMALE trainers at all. I was told they ""we're looking into it."" 5 months, nothing has changed. 

When I first signed up in June, they had fairly standard childcare hours of 8-12pm and 4-7pm. I was disappointed that there were no weekend hours. The play area was just a few balls and some toys and a TV. My kid told me it was boring and usually ended up watching a movie instead of being active like me!

Despite repeated promises they were looking for staff, they actually reduced the childcare hours. When I came in on a Friday, I was told that they had changed the childcare from 5 days to only 3. While they said they had put up notice, I saw nothing (as I didn't use the childcare all the time). The front desk person actually said, ""Well have you ever been here before?"" 

When I voiced a complaint, the manager was matter of fact that that's how it was. They showed no interest in my concerns or having me as a member. 

Basically if you live near Fiesta Mall, try a different place to workout than Bally's. This Bally's is rundown and should be closed!

Oh and a note about Bally's scam on membership. You can't just cancel! You have to write them a letter and tell them in several steps about what you want to cancel. It sits at some corporate office until they get around to cancelling. Wanna try and negotiate a faster cancellation? Call 1-866 40Ballys.",gmail,Yahoo,"Clean facility, OK equipment.

I get out there as often as I can, and these are my favorite courses in town to play. Apparently it isn't often enough because I can't seem to shimmy my score much under 90 with any frequency. 

Anyhow, of the two, I prefer the Links. It is much more picturesque and manages to frame more of the southwestern desert landscape. The 16th hole on the backside of the Links is one of the best views of the city . . .

The Adobe is more old-school, and easier (not that I have the right to call any golf course ""easy""). It is rolling and green with less water than the Links and much more room for error as many of the fairways bleed together. There are more trees on Adobe and it almost feels like you're no longer in Arizona . . . until you realize that the sun is about to set and it's still well over a hundred degrees.

I joined 24 Hour back in October when I was living in Colorado.  The clubs in Denver are pristine, and I had high expectations for the clubs in Scottsdale (after all, it is Scottsdale, right?).  This gym used to be owned by a completely different company (the signs on the locker room doors say ""Attention Club X Members...."") and 24 Hour has done little to improve the quality and selection of the equipment.  

I feel like it's a gym out of the 80s, complete with neon signs guiding one into the locker rooms.  All of the equipment is crammed upstairs, and the machines are frequently broken, squeaky and uncalibrated.  They even lock up the bosu balls in a closet, in fear that someone will break their neck using one, which is understandable, but I hate asking permission to carry on my routine!  The only open space is in one of the studios, which is perpetually humid (and often 10 degrees warmer than the main part of the gym).

It's usually packed around 5 pm and I often find myself waiting for a machine.  When it's raining outside the rain drips through spots in the ceiling, splashing onto the dirty carpet and on the equipment (water + electricity = potential death) . This particular location gives me the impression that the cleaning crew doesn't come by often, so I always disinfect the equipment before I use it.

But, this is my gym and I do like the staff and the trainers; I like coming here.  They aren't pretentious like many of the individuals in Scottsdale; it's refreshing to go to a no-frills club.  No drama, no pressure to join any classes or have personal training.  No ex-coworkers.   I can do my thing without having the annoyance of trophy wives sizing me up.

owned by a completely different company (the signs on the locker room doors say ""attention club x members...."") and 24 hour has done little to improve the quality and selection of the equipment. i feel like it is a gym out of the 80s, complete with neon signs guiding one into the locker rooms. all of the equipment is crammed upstairs, and the machines are frequently broken, squeaky and uncalibrated. they even lock up the bosu balls in a closet, in fear that someone will break their neck using one, which is understandable, but i hate asking permission to carry on my routine! the only open space is in one of the studios, which is perpetually humid (and often 10 degrees warmer than the main part of the gym). it is usually packed around 5 pm and i often find myself waiting for a machine. when it is raining outside the rain drips through spots in the ceiling, splashing onto the dirty carpet and on the equipment (water + electricity = potential death) . this particular location gives me the impression that the cleaning crew does not come by often, so i always disinfect the equipment before i use it. but, this is my gym and i do like the staff and the trainers; i like coming here. they are not pretentious like many of the individuals in scottsdale; it is refreshing to go to a no-frills club. no drama, no pressure to join any classes or have personal training. no ex-coworkers. i can do my thing without having the annoyance of trophy wives sizing me up. i know i cannot blame the quality and lack of equipment on the staff, and they have told me themselves they wish they could get new items in faster, but it is a matter of budget (and they have no control over that). i'm praying 24 hour's headquarters will read this and make the much needed improvements to

1) 24 Hour Fitness is a SilverSneakers fitness club offered by my health insurance plan.
2) Less than 2 miles from home.

My one major objection to this club is they do not offer SilverSneakers fitness classes. I know over 20 SilverSneaker seniors from the now ""out-of-business"" Bally's on Longmore that desperately need a facility in the Dobson Ranch area to take SilverSneakers group exercise classes. 

In my opinion the exercise area is bright and well supplied with equipment. It does feel somewhat cramped because they have a lot of equipment. There seems to be all age groups represented in the membership. I think it has a good energy. 

I don't understand some of the other reviewers criticisms about the facility being dated, worn looking, etc. I don't live here, I exercise here. I'm fairly picky about cleanliness and, so far, haven't found anything that jumped out as dirty, including the women's locker room

I do wonder why the TV's seem to always have two of the four sets on ESPN & ESPN2, and the other two channels on Fox News & CNN. It's too inconvenient to go back downstairs and request a channel change. What's wrong with local TV stations?

bright and well supplied with equipment. it does feel somewhat cramped because they have a lot of equipment. there seems to be all age groups represented in the membership. i think it has a good energy. i do not understand some of the other reviewers criticisms about the facility being dated, worn looking, etc. i do not live here, i exercise here. i'm fairly picky about cleanliness and, so far, have not found anything that jumped out as dirty, including the women's locker room i do wonder why the tv's seem to always have two of the four sets on espn & espn2, and the other two channels on fox news & cnn. it is too inconvenient to go back downstairs and request a channel change. what is wrong with local tv stations? one suggestion that would help me, and perhaps other like me that

I grew up going to LA Fitness on the west side of town and I also was a member of 24 Hour Fitness in Tempe, so I'll use those as comparisons.  I also am a ""gym person"" so take that into account so you don't think I'm just bitching about having to work out my fat ass.

The problem with this location is I have been at pretty much every time possible and it's RIDICULOUSLY busy.  If you're into doing free weights or weight machines, I wouldn't waste my money signing up for a membership.  If you're interested in doing classes and just doing cardio (treadmills, etc.) I'd say you'd be fine and it's only $25/mo which is a great deal honestly.  I can say without a doubt that there is usually at least 2 open treadmills and a few elipticals.  However, NEVER can I seem to jump on any weight machine and the free weights area is a Scottsdale DB haven...I think there actually might be a giant magnet that attracts them there by the dozens.  They must get a discount if they wear Affliction shirts to work-out in.  

One last ditty - the front desk staff are hard-core bitches.  I'm not sure why they hate their lives that much, but they're not nice.  The ""trainers"" they have you talk with aren't much better, but really put the hard sell on why you need to spend thousands of dollars on their service, so be prepared.

Conclusion - I cancelled my account but if you're only interested in going for classes (I only did spinning and they were decent classes) and cardio, probably worth the $25.

I've not gone back into the locker room. I live close enough that after hearing the reports of the bathroom I just go home to clean off.

HOW IS THIS GYM STILL IN BUSINESS?

The manager is your classic gym jackass that makes people who work at gyms look bad.  Pushy, dishonest gym membership sales.  

I've seen a personal trainer and the manager ogle girls, rarely see them doing any work.

A few of the front desk staff were cool.  Just very underpaid and obviously passing through.

The men's locker room is disgusting.  

No joke, more than half the equipment is broken or has something wrong with it.

I do believe about 80% of the problem is with the manager.  A quick renovation and new management could do wonders for this spot.

Why did I keep going?  Convenience and locked into a 1 year employee benefit type membership.  I visited the gym about 40 times over 5 months while I was recovering from injury and at least it has a pool, 2 large jacuzzis (jet therapy), steam room, and free weights...when they are operable.  

I can't tell you how many times I've seen customers waiting out front with no one out at the front desk.

One Sunday morning no one on staff bothered to show up to open the gym.  I eventually just left after 45 minutes, who knows when they finally showed up.  I saw about 40 members either waiting or came and left.

i can't tell you how many times i've seen customers waiting out front with no one out at the front desk.

one sunday morning no one on staff bothered to show up to open the gym.  i eventually just left after 45 minutes, who knows when they finally showed up.  i saw about 40 members either waiting or came and left.

worst. gym (management). ever.","i've gotta agree with jesse on the only other review.  

how is this gym still in business?

the manager is your classic gym jackass that makes people who work at gyms look bad.  pushy, dishonest gym membership sales.  

i've seen a personal trainer and the manager ogle girls, rarely see them doing any work.

a few of the front desk staff were cool.  just very underpaid and obviously passing through.

the men's locker room is disgusting.  

no joke, more than half the equipment is broken or has something wrong with it.

So to avoid further harassment from my daughter we decided to look into joining a gym about a month ago.  After doing some research the YMCA seemed to be the best fit for us.

We joined as a family about a month ago and so far I am really enjoying the YMCA in Scottsdale.  If you are looking for a well maintained gym that has a pool, tons of classes, and a day care (at no additional cost with the family plan) and not full of muscle heads this is the place for you.  

I have taken about 10 spin classes so far and Lisa is a great instructor at 5:30am so definitely recommend giving her class a try if you can get your butt up early enough.  Every time I have gone my day has seemed to be more productive.

For those (and I am one of them) that need extra motivation to work out the YMCA uses a progress logging system called Fitlinx.  You can sign up for a free intro to the machines that are part of this system.  Each time you visit the gym you log in and those circuit or cardio machines (and there are many) that are tied into the Fitlinx system it will record your progress.  The YMCA even reports weekly progress of top members so for those competitive folks this is the perfect incentive to getting off the couch and into the gym.  I know its working for me as I don't like seeing my name so far down the list.

for those (and i am one of them) that need extra motivation to work out the ymca uses a progress logging system called fitlinx.  you can sign up for a free intro to the machines that are part of this system.  each time you visit the gym you log in and those circuit or cardio machines (and there are many) that are tied into the fitlinx system it will record your progress.  the ymca even reports weekly progress of top members so for those competitive folks this is the perfect incentive to getting off the couch and into the gym.  i know its working for me as i don't like seeing my name so far down the list.

for the price the ymca is definitely worth checking out if you are considering joining a gym.","the wii fit is fun way to workout but realized thanks to my daughter that its not a ""real"" work out.  so to avoid further harassment from my daughter we decided to look into joining a gym about a month ago.  after doing some research the ymca seemed to be the best fit for us.

This gym has some awesome [looking] routes!  For those of us accustomed to seeing an""abcd"" rating system (i.e. 5.10a, 5.10b, etc), its a little bit mysterious and enticing that this place uses a ""+/-"" rating system.  Esco said it was actually exciting to go into a climb with no preconceived estimation of its difficulty; just get on the wall and climb. And it seemed the skill set required from one climb to the next  could be drastically different - from wide slow static climbs demanding of a strong core and limber/flexible reach, to climbs requiring dynos from contorted postures and awkward launches...

The climbing walls here see quite a bit of wear, evident by the exposed wooden surface underneath the paint that has been worn away in places; smooth wooden surface atop a welded metal framework, not much different structurally. However, the lack of textured wall surfaces renders most of the ascents a straightforward use of grips and footchips; stemming and smearing is hard to do on a smoothfaced wall.

At first, we were concerned that with myself laid up in crutches we would have only one certified belay person for our group of 4, but Phoenix Rock allows people to belay after just a 10minute video orientation and brief hands-on instruction.  A great place for groups of beginners!

The staffer who assisted us was a charismatic and friendly guy by the name of Gravity.  Really.  Great nickname for a climbing gym staffer, right?  He made our newer climbers comfortable with their equipment and took special care to relay and emphasize all the safety precautions and practices of rock climbing and belaying. Throughout the day, as he made his rounds through the gym, he'd occasionally come by to coach our newer climbers and offer tips and advice to our more adept climbers attempting difficult ascents.

Altogether a nice climbing gym with a homegrown decor and vibe.  I wish I had the chance to climb here and experience the different route/rating system, but even from the sidelines, I can say this is an awesome place.

If ever I'm back in Phoenix (and back on my feet!), I'm checking this place out again.

the climbing walls here see quite a bit of wear, evident by the exposed wooden surface underneath the paint that has been worn away in places; smooth wooden surface atop a welded metal framework, not much different structurally. however, the lack of textured wall surfaces renders most of the ascents a straightforward use of grips and footchips; stemming and smearing is hard to do on a smoothfaced wall.

at first, we were concerned that with myself laid up in crutches we would have only one certified belay person for our group of 4, but phoenix rock allows people to belay after just a 10minute video orientation and brief hands-on instruction.  a great place for groups of beginners!

the staffer who assisted us was a charismatic and friendly guy by the name of gravity.  really.  great nickname for a climbing gym staffer, right?  he made our newer climbers comfortable with their equipment and took special care to relay and emphasize all the safety precautions and practices of rock climbing and belaying. throughout the day, as he made his rounds through the gym, he'd occasionally come by to coach our newer climbers and offer tips and advice to our more adept climbers attempting difficult ascents.

altogether a nice climbing gym with a homegrown decor and vibe.  i wish i had the chance to climb here and experience the different route/rating system, but even from the sidelines, i can say this is an awesome place.

if ever i'm back in phoenix (and back on my feet!), i'm checking this place out again.

The building is always clean and well-kept, even the locker rooms, which never have that gross B.O. smell like other places. The heated pools are never nasty.

Sometimes things break down, but that's because it's a big building with a lot of equipment. They seem to do their very best to make repairs quickly.

Tish provides great adjustments in class, and the music is always peaceful and at a reasonable volume.  You can really learn a lot from her classes regarding alignment and posture benefits, and you may even pick up a bit of Sanskrit (postures are announced in both English and Sanskrit).  In comparison to other studios in greater Phoenix, Hegel Yoga is the most reasonably priced that I have found.  It's a one-of-a-kind studio!  

I highly recommend the Sivananda class - don't be scared by the name - it's a class that focuses on each of the body chakras.  And I also recommend the Ashtanga classes - Tish offers a student-friendly approach to Ashtanga where students are guided from posture to posture so there's no need to have the entire sequence memorized.

The location is a bit hard to find.. park near the AJ's and walk into the corner of the complex. I just followed the girls with yoga mats after I wandered around a bit. TIP: the cubbies are in the bathroom, not at the entrance. 

The studio was definitely not what I expected, but in a really good way. The staff was very friendly, the studio was carpeted and relaxed unlike other places I've been. I hate the elite attitude of some yoga studios in Phoenix but this place totally lacked that competitive and snotty Scottsdale yoga/soccer/wino Mom vibe. 

The yoga itself was difficult. I consider myself quite fit and healthy and seriously, this class kicked my ass for the next two days. DRINK WATER. Bring 2 bottles. Wear layers and be prepared to take them off. Don't wear lotion or sunscreen; you will sweat it off and it will burn your eyes. I don't even recommended wearing contacts because mine basically swam in my sweat the whole hour and a half.

...but in a good way, hot yoga can be intense but its good for you! Sumits' yoga style is very similar to that of Bikram's Yoga, but much faster and a few postures in the set are different. Otherwise, you get the same benefits and you sweat all of those gnarly toxins out! Get in shape, feel balanced, get to stare at yourself in a mirror with no shame, and sweat like a dog for 90-mins! 

And if you don't come out feeling brand spanking new, then I think you slacked off in class! Make sure you go to the website or talk to someone who has already faced the experience that is Sumits Yoga before you hop right into it, there's a lot of things that you should do in preparation! 

Seriously, I went in here hungover once, thinking I'd be fine...oh lordts no!

Plus its really nice in here, and spacious. And please people shower before you go home (its a clean one!), I don't know how you could go home without doing so, that's a really gross drive and I'd never ride in your car. The prices can be kinda harsh, only if you plan on committing to a long class package, but there are discounts and specials ran all the time, currently I think you can sign up for 30 days for free.",gmail,Yahoo,"Sumits KILLS!!!
