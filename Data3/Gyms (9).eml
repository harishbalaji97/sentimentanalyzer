Best time to work out at this gym is in the early morning.  Went in the afternoon a few times and it's usually packed.  

This place has everything I need to work out. (threadmill, free weights, machines, basketball court, swimming pool, and sauna).  Rarely do I see any of the machines out of order/ broken.  Although the men's sauna bench was broken for maybe 2-3 months before they finally fixed it.
