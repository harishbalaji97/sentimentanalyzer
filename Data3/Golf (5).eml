This is a review of the Champions course at TPC.  Overall, this course is a big disappointment.  The conditions were poor with the greens bombarded with ball marks, tee boxes filled with divots.  The course looks like a run down, old course.  Maintenance must be on vacation here...How dare the PGA put their name on this course with such bad conditions. 

The layout feels like a muni someplace in Texas.  The holes, most especially the par 3s, are plain vanilla.  Finally, if you come to Scottsdale thinking this is a desert course you will be disappointed.  There isn't a cactus to be found here, and the desert is hard pan waste areas.  No desert.  The cart girl disappeared for 2 hours in the heat of the day.  When we asked where she went the reply was "I went to lunch".  Hun, have lunch on the damn cart! There are many many better choices for golf nearby.  I would not return here again.
