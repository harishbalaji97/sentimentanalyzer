My husband brought me here so I could try climbing for the first time. I don't like heights but when the activity looks safe I won't let my fears prevent me from trying it.  I think the scariest part was realizing I had to "belay" him and be responsible for his safety. He's a good guy so I figured I'd keep him around. 
They give you a harness, and horribly uncomfortable climbing shoes. Maybe I had the wrong size? The video wasn't really helpful I have to admit. You can't learn anything from it as a first timer, you really need that 1:1 instruction that is provided afterwards to teach you how to fasten the ropes and check them. That part of the instruction was great. 
The climbs are labeled with degree of difficulty, so you can choose accordingly. One of the hardest parts is letting go of the wall as your partner lowers you down. It was nice to see all levels of experience in there.  A few other newbies like me on the same courses, and there were also a few show-offs...ok, I'm just jealous they were really impressive.
Verdict? Yes, it was pretty cool. Check it out!
