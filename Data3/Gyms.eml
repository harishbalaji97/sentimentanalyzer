I have been coming to this LA Fitness for five years. Whether that bodes well for me or not I will leave up to your discretion. I have seen better days before my metabolism decided to hibernate.

What I will say is that there is something about this location that makes it way more comfortable than any of the other locations I have been to (7th Ave/Greenway, Elliot/Priest, Warner/Dobson, Scottsdale/McDowell). Perhaps it is the lower ceiling. Perhaps it is all the gay men. It could even be the nostalgia from the time I tore my hamstring. Who knows.

Here are the only drawbacks I can see:

1. Don't try to do cardio right after work on a Monday or Tuesday. 
2. You can easily become intoxicated on Saturday or Sunday morning... it seems all the party people feel the need to atone for their sins the night before by sweating it out in the morning
3. Those personal trainers are suh-leeee-zeee
4. If you dislike cutoff sleeves on men, this is their mecca. 

Ample parking. Cheap monthly fee of $24.99. It doesn't smell. Lots of equipment. 

Get off your fat ass and just go.
