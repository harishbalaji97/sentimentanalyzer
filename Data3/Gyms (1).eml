I am a member at all the Villages, but I really like the DC ranch location.  It is Big and Open, with all the things a good Health Club needs.  The steam rooms and locer rooms are always clean.  The classes they offer are great and there is something for everyone.  The restaurant has a little of everything.  They also do a lot of community events and socials to introduce you to your membership.  This is more than a health club it is a community.
