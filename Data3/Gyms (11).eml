Typical LA Fitness. This one has a lap pool and decent equipment. If you want to go when it isn't busy go around 11-3 and 9 to close. From what I seen those times there isn't a lot of people there. I hate waiting for weights or machines to open especially when you have people that keep talking and hanging out.
