Full disclosure - I am not a member and never have been. I tried this gym last week using a 3 day pass. 

I will not be signing up. 

This gym is extremely busy. It is very challenging to put in a good workout without waiting for the majority of my workout. I even found myself waiting around just for some extra space to stretch before lifting.  One afternoon there was an entire high school football team working out which I thought odd considering it was the 5pm rush hour. 

On a positive note this gym might have the most attractive clientele that I have ever seen. It's on par with the Lifetime up near Scottsdale and the 101 only this gym's demographics are much younger. If I were 10 years younger I would probably join this gym just to walk around and socialize. Maybe get in a few sets in between fist bumps with the fellas. Fortunately I am wise enough to know that there are better places than the gym to socialize and better places than LA Fitness to work out.
