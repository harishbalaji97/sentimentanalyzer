The Wii Fit is fun way to workout but realized thanks to my daughter that its not a "real" work out.  So to avoid further harassment from my daughter we decided to look into joining a gym about a month ago.  After doing some research the YMCA seemed to be the best fit for us.

We joined as a family about a month ago and so far I am really enjoying the YMCA in Scottsdale.  If you are looking for a well maintained gym that has a pool, tons of classes, and a day care (at no additional cost with the family plan) and not full of muscle heads this is the place for you.  

I have taken about 10 spin classes so far and Lisa is a great instructor at 5:30am so definitely recommend giving her class a try if you can get your butt up early enough.  Every time I have gone my day has seemed to be more productive.

For those (and I am one of them) that need extra motivation to work out the YMCA uses a progress logging system called Fitlinx.  You can sign up for a free intro to the machines that are part of this system.  Each time you visit the gym you log in and those circuit or cardio machines (and there are many) that are tied into the Fitlinx system it will record your progress.  The YMCA even reports weekly progress of top members so for those competitive folks this is the perfect incentive to getting off the couch and into the gym.  I know its working for me as I don't like seeing my name so far down the list.

For the price the YMCA is definitely worth checking out if you are considering joining a gym.
