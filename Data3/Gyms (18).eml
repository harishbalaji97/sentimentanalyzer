This place is always kind of a disappointment. 

I go in to work out. I don't need some bunch of douche nozzles just hanging out on one to three machines, refusing to let anyone work in with them. This is part of what a gym manager needs to do. If you see some assbag camped out on different machines, not using them, but holding claim to them none the less, you need to explain to said individual that is not how the gym works. I've seen more than a few really ugly fights break out in gyms for less than this. 

I've not gone back into the locker room. I live close enough that after hearing the reports of the bathroom I just go home to clean off. 

All and all not worth what I pay every month, but unfortunately the only thing close enough for me to use it.

Also the personal trainer call you get after joining up is annoying. I explained I wasn't interested in the service, and the calls just kept coming. That's just lame sauce.

LA Fitness: If you want to improve your scores and the over all happiness of your members, actually earn your money! Go out, police the floor a little bit. When you see the same individuals abusing the equipment, hogging benches and machines, give them a talking to. As members we shouldn't have to do this, but rest assured if the problem doesn't abate with the same people I always see doing it, I will have words with them myself.
