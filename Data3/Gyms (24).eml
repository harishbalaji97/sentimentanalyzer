Ok , I wanted to like this place. I really really did. Really badly wanted this to be a five star experience. Heres my gripe. 

Machines are old, just plain old. Some were creaky and some werent working. Maybe it was fix em all day or something. Whatever.

The squat rack bars are too thin. I hate this, some may like it but I dont want to spend time thinking about the pain on my neck and back when squatting when I could be lifting. Also the foam pads to prevent this are missing , something my local LA fitness does.

The weight went up to 120lbs which was awesome and I think my local one only goes upto 100lbs but given the number of people waiting when you work out really isnt fun. 

I did not avail of the other classes and the like but the place just felt musty and old. Solid 1 star experience, not quiet sure what the second one was for but whatever. I wont be goin back,
