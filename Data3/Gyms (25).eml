Unlike most 24 hour Fitness in the valley, this one is substandard, dirty, machines are often broken. The parking lot and entrance are dark and cars often speed through the lot. 

The staff upfront are generally inattentive and often chatting with each other rather helping customers. 

The TV's in the treadmill room are exclusively on conservative news channels with no hope of ever changing them. Trust me, I've asked many times for a change of just one TV channel, no luck.
