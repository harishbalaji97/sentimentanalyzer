I was greeted and inquired about a membership by the friendly staff. I received a good tour and everyone seemed very nice. Then I was handed over to the sales guy and inquired about a coupon I had. He didn't recognize it and said he would get back to me, but wanted me to pay before I left, stating he would refund my money if the coupon was good. Um, no. I said I would wait and asked for a 5 day pass so I could try it out and see how busy it would be during the peak times. He gave me a pass and said he would call and let me know about the coupon. Crickets. So two days later I left my name and phone number at the front desk for him again. Crickets. Two days later... again left my info. Crickets. It's been awhile now with absolutely no follow up.

The facility is clean and everything was new and working fine. They have lots of classes and it seems like a great place to work out. But another gym I also tried actually wanted my business and gave me an offer I couldn't refuse. Oh, and I also work at a local business and am in charge of the HR department for about 130 employees. We purchased a corporate membership and passed on the incentives to our employees. Almost half of our employees signed up, and a lot included their spouses too. Sometimes it comes down to customer service, which sadly this one didn't deliver.
