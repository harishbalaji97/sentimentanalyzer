i wasn't at this gym for too long so theres not much I can say about it except that the experience here was a positive one.  This gym reminds me of the mission village location I usually go to in mo val (local speak for moreno valley).  The locker room has that contraption that wrings the water out of your swimsuit, and is equipped with 2 blow dryers.  The pool wasn't too crowded and had all 4 lanes rather than 3 like some of the other la fitness gyms I go to.
