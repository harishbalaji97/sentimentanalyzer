Since I only seem to review spas, restaurants and bars, figured I'd step out and try to make myself appear as a functioning member of society.

I grew up going to LA Fitness on the west side of town and I also was a member of 24 Hour Fitness in Tempe, so I'll use those as comparisons.  I also am a "gym person" so take that into account so you don't think I'm just bitching about having to work out my fat ass.

The problem with this location is I have been at pretty much every time possible and it's RIDICULOUSLY busy.  If you're into doing free weights or weight machines, I wouldn't waste my money signing up for a membership.  If you're interested in doing classes and just doing cardio (treadmills, etc.) I'd say you'd be fine and it's only $25/mo which is a great deal honestly.  I can say without a doubt that there is usually at least 2 open treadmills and a few elipticals.  However, NEVER can I seem to jump on any weight machine and the free weights area is a Scottsdale DB haven...I think there actually might be a giant magnet that attracts them there by the dozens.  They must get a discount if they wear Affliction shirts to work-out in.  

One last ditty - the front desk staff are hard-core bitches.  I'm not sure why they hate their lives that much, but they're not nice.  The "trainers" they have you talk with aren't much better, but really put the hard sell on why you need to spend thousands of dollars on their service, so be prepared.

Conclusion - I cancelled my account but if you're only interested in going for classes (I only did spinning and they were decent classes) and cardio, probably worth the $25.  If you like a more well-rounded gym, go to 24 Hour Fitness for a little better quality for just a little more $ per month.
