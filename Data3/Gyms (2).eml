I've been at this gym since it opened.  It is very clean and all the equipment is new.  It's never too crowded.  That's all I ask for with a gym.  I have a few friends still at LA Fitness and I always tell them it's totally worth the extra few bucks to join this gym.  I was at Lifetime also in the past.  That place is great but it also costs twice as much and I never used half the stuff they offered.  Overall, 5 stars for keeping clean showers, clean towels and good equipment available.  All the people whining about the contract, etc..Good Grief!  Any gym you join is going to have a contract for you to complain about.
