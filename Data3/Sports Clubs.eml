I play in two leagues and I give one a five star review and the other a three star review.

Kickball is a super fun way to meet cool people and get out of the house. It's also a great excuse for getting drunk in public on a weeknight. WAKA does a great job of organizing and works out amazing deals with the sponsor bars. The fees for the season are reasonable and the amount of fun that you will have is limitless.
