Don't buy Nike sneakers if you want to return or exchange them.. I've bought many from them. I went this week  and bought 2 pairs of Nike SB's that were already over retail price as it is.. I tried on one side then bought them... When I got home I realized that one of the shoes were damaged.. It's only been 2 days and they said they can't take it back.. I've bought many shoes there and this will be the last time... I'm from Nor Cal and people are crazy about sneakers out there and all the shops will accept a return or exchanged within 14- 30 days.. This was the first place that does not do that.. Why? Because sneakers and SB's are not big in AZ... They don't sell here.. I wouldn't buy them there if I were you.
