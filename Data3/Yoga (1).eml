Tish is absolutely the best.  The studio atmosphere is down-to-earth and mirror-free.  Tish provides great adjustments in class, and the music is always peaceful and at a reasonable volume.  You can really learn a lot from her classes regarding alignment and posture benefits, and you may even pick up a bit of Sanskrit (postures are announced in both English and Sanskrit).  In comparison to other studios in greater Phoenix, Hegel Yoga is the most reasonably priced that I have found.  It's a one-of-a-kind studio!  

I highly recommend the Sivananda class - don't be scared by the name - it's a class that focuses on each of the body chakras.  And I also recommend the Ashtanga classes - Tish offers a student-friendly approach to Ashtanga where students are guided from posture to posture so there's no need to have the entire sequence memorized.  If that's not your style - check out the schedule of classes on Tish's website - there are classes for all levels and yoga interests.  

Namaste.
