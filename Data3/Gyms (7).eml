Unfortunately, I'd broken my ankle two weeks before I was supposed to go on this Phoenix trip and couldn't participate, but nonetheless, we'd planned on hitting this climbing facility with friends and so we did; incapacitated, I was still eager to see my friends take to the walls...

This gym has some awesome [looking] routes!  For those of us accustomed to seeing an"abcd" rating system (i.e. 5.10a, 5.10b, etc), its a little bit mysterious and enticing that this place uses a "+/-" rating system.  Esco said it was actually exciting to go into a climb with no preconceived estimation of its difficulty; just get on the wall and climb. And it seemed the skill set required from one climb to the next  could be drastically different - from wide slow static climbs demanding of a strong core and limber/flexible reach, to climbs requiring dynos from contorted postures and awkward launches...

The climbing walls here see quite a bit of wear, evident by the exposed wooden surface underneath the paint that has been worn away in places; smooth wooden surface atop a welded metal framework, not much different structurally. However, the lack of textured wall surfaces renders most of the ascents a straightforward use of grips and footchips; stemming and smearing is hard to do on a smoothfaced wall.

At first, we were concerned that with myself laid up in crutches we would have only one certified belay person for our group of 4, but Phoenix Rock allows people to belay after just a 10minute video orientation and brief hands-on instruction.  A great place for groups of beginners!

The staffer who assisted us was a charismatic and friendly guy by the name of Gravity.  Really.  Great nickname for a climbing gym staffer, right?  He made our newer climbers comfortable with their equipment and took special care to relay and emphasize all the safety precautions and practices of rock climbing and belaying. Throughout the day, as he made his rounds through the gym, he'd occasionally come by to coach our newer climbers and offer tips and advice to our more adept climbers attempting difficult ascents.

Altogether a nice climbing gym with a homegrown decor and vibe.  I wish I had the chance to climb here and experience the different route/rating system, but even from the sidelines, I can say this is an awesome place.

If ever I'm back in Phoenix (and back on my feet!), I'm checking this place out again.

They (or at least Gravity) would have let me climb one-legged... he himself having broke both of his ankles and took a break from climbing before could tell I was fiend'ing...
