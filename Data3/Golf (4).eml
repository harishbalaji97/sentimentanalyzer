Please, please, YELP, stop forcing reviewers to award one star when not only does a place deserve ZERO stars but actually should receive a MINUS rating!   The Metro Phoenix area has an abundance of very attractive 9-hole golf courses .... and then there is this poor excuse.  Even worse, in my opinion, it is dangerous and attempting to negotiate one's way around it is risking a sprained or broken ankle thanks to the abundance of prairie dog holes littering the unkempt fairways.  Having risen early in order to play 9 holes before the temperature got too hot, I gritted my teeth and worked my way around this disaster.  My wife, however, looked over those rodent holes and decided she was safer sitting in the cart so declined to play (even though she had paid).  Speaking of green fees, one might expect Adobe Dam to offer very low fees due to its condition but dream on ..... last week of May, $12 plus $10 for cart!   The course is poorly marked; one cannot tell from the tee box which hole one is about to play and the course layout on the scorecard was difficult to decipher.   I would never visit this place again and highly recommend readers look elsewhere to play a round of golf.
