After visiting another gym in Scottsdale (which I won't name here), I decided to edit this review.  I joined 24 Hour back in October when I was living in Colorado.  The clubs in Denver are pristine, and I had high expectations for the clubs in Scottsdale (after all, it is Scottsdale, right?).  This gym used to be owned by a completely different company (the signs on the locker room doors say "Attention Club X Members....") and 24 Hour has done little to improve the quality and selection of the equipment.  

I feel like it's a gym out of the 80s, complete with neon signs guiding one into the locker rooms.  All of the equipment is crammed upstairs, and the machines are frequently broken, squeaky and uncalibrated.  They even lock up the bosu balls in a closet, in fear that someone will break their neck using one, which is understandable, but I hate asking permission to carry on my routine!  The only open space is in one of the studios, which is perpetually humid (and often 10 degrees warmer than the main part of the gym).

It's usually packed around 5 pm and I often find myself waiting for a machine.  When it's raining outside the rain drips through spots in the ceiling, splashing onto the dirty carpet and on the equipment (water + electricity = potential death) . This particular location gives me the impression that the cleaning crew doesn't come by often, so I always disinfect the equipment before I use it.

But, this is my gym and I do like the staff and the trainers; I like coming here.  They aren't pretentious like many of the individuals in Scottsdale; it's refreshing to go to a no-frills club.  No drama, no pressure to join any classes or have personal training.  No ex-coworkers.   I can do my thing without having the annoyance of trophy wives sizing me up.  I know I can't blame the quality and lack of equipment on the staff, and they've told me themselves they wish they could get new items in faster, but it's a matter of budget (and they have no control over that).  I'm praying 24 Hour's headquarters will read this and make the much needed improvements to this location.
