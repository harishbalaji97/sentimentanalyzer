This is a rip off right now. Online shows $22 rate, they sneak in a gps fee, and add small range balls your rate ends up being $37 with the worst greens in the valley. You can play far better high end courses for cheaper in the summer. Stay away.  The only way to describe this course is that it is Over Designed
