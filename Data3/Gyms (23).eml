I've gotta agree with Jesse on the only other review.  

HOW IS THIS GYM STILL IN BUSINESS?

The manager is your classic gym jackass that makes people who work at gyms look bad.  Pushy, dishonest gym membership sales.  

I've seen a personal trainer and the manager ogle girls, rarely see them doing any work.

A few of the front desk staff were cool.  Just very underpaid and obviously passing through.

The men's locker room is disgusting.  

No joke, more than half the equipment is broken or has something wrong with it.

I do believe about 80% of the problem is with the manager.  A quick renovation and new management could do wonders for this spot.

Why did I keep going?  Convenience and locked into a 1 year employee benefit type membership.  I visited the gym about 40 times over 5 months while I was recovering from injury and at least it has a pool, 2 large jacuzzis (jet therapy), steam room, and free weights...when they are operable.  

I can't tell you how many times I've seen customers waiting out front with no one out at the front desk.

One Sunday morning no one on staff bothered to show up to open the gym.  I eventually just left after 45 minutes, who knows when they finally showed up.  I saw about 40 members either waiting or came and left.

Worst. Gym (Management). Ever.
