I've been a member at this location for about a month. I chose it for several reasons: 
1) 24 Hour Fitness is a SilverSneakers fitness club offered by my health insurance plan.
2) Less than 2 miles from home.

My one major objection to this club is they do not offer SilverSneakers fitness classes. I know over 20 SilverSneaker seniors from the now "out-of-business" Bally's on Longmore that desperately need a facility in the Dobson Ranch area to take SilverSneakers group exercise classes. 

In my opinion the exercise area is bright and well supplied with equipment. It does feel somewhat cramped because they have a lot of equipment. There seems to be all age groups represented in the membership. I think it has a good energy. 

I don't understand some of the other reviewers criticisms about the facility being dated, worn looking, etc. I don't live here, I exercise here. I'm fairly picky about cleanliness and, so far, haven't found anything that jumped out as dirty, including the women's locker room

I do wonder why the TV's seem to always have two of the four sets on ESPN & ESPN2, and the other two channels on Fox News & CNN. It's too inconvenient to go back downstairs and request a channel change. What's wrong with local TV stations?

One suggestion that would help me, and perhaps other like me that aren't resistance machine savvy, is to have a trainer in the area to answer questions about the machines setup, offer suggestions about how to use the equipment, and correct any bad form they may spot.
