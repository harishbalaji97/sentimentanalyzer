I haven't played here, but I have used the practice range a handful of times.  I prefer Karsten, but it's a bit pricey for a bucket of balls so I come here when I'm on the cheap.  The staff isn't the friendliest here and the practice range is an afterthought, but it's a good place to work on your game every once in a while.
