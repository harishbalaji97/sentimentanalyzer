I got a discount off of Groupon for a month, and even after the first class I'm hooked!

The location is a bit hard to find.. park near the AJ's and walk into the corner of the complex. I just followed the girls with yoga mats after I wandered around a bit. TIP: the cubbies are in the bathroom, not at the entrance. 

The studio was definitely not what I expected, but in a really good way. The staff was very friendly, the studio was carpeted and relaxed unlike other places I've been. I hate the elite attitude of some yoga studios in Phoenix but this place totally lacked that competitive and snotty Scottsdale yoga/soccer/wino Mom vibe. 

The yoga itself was difficult. I consider myself quite fit and healthy and seriously, this class kicked my ass for the next two days. DRINK WATER. Bring 2 bottles. Wear layers and be prepared to take them off. Don't wear lotion or sunscreen; you will sweat it off and it will burn your eyes. I don't even recommended wearing contacts because mine basically swam in my sweat the whole hour and a half. 

The smell takes a bit of getting used to, as does the whooshing sounds (I had to bite my lip to keep me from laughing) and sweating. Overall though, the staff is great, the physical studio is great and best of all, it's not snobby yoga!
