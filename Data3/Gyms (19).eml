They finally cleaned the inside up quite a bit, but it wasn't enough for me to stay and keep paying $28/month. Some of the nasty carpet was ripped out and replaced with tile. And they put in TVs along with new lockers and benches in the locker rooms. 

One of the noticeable things is the complete lack of women in this gym, and especially in the spa and swimming pool. There's usually 5-6 guys in the spa and it's kind of weird. One time, I was doing laps in the pool and caught this really hot, 5'11" modeling chick at one end. This WT creeper hops in the pool like 20 feet from her. She probably got nervous and left, cause I never saw her again. So FYI if you're even a decent-looking chick; you'll be in the minority here.

I added a few pictures. They drained the pool in October but overlooked a few dirty spots at the water level. Also, people will just hop in the spa after a workout (without showering), so you'll see dirt bubbles floating at the top. This is completely unacceptable. The 24 Hour Fitness a few miles to the east of here has got this place beat. It's also available for less than half the cost of LA Fitness if you buy the Costco 2-year plan.
