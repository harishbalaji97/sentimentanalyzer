My husband and I have been members of the Ahwatukee Y for many years and this month we were charged an additional $20 with no notice of the increase or further information.  I tried to get pricing on the internet for the  valley Y's, but it is not available.  So I called the general information number and was told the price increased to $75 in this demographic area. Each Y charges a different price and now you have to pay a premium to go to another Y in the valley (at least that is what I was told!).  In the past we have supported the Y by donating to them through the Valley of the Sun United Way, etc. but I think this is unfair marketing tactics depending on who you talk to on the phone.  One woman even said I had to belong to the one nearest my house even if I wanted to go to one near a place of employment! I called the Tempe Y and they said their price is $80 for two people, but my friends in Mesa pay $38.  I think the Phoenix YMCA needs to simplify their marketing techniques and make it fair for those on fixed incomes, with no families, no need for the pools, no need for classes, rock wall etc.  All we want to do is use the treadmill a couple times a week.  I am ready to quit, but my husband wants to continue, so we will see.....
