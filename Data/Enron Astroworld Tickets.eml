Enron announces UNLIMITED discounted AstroWorld tickets for employees.

Due to overwhelming employee feedback, we have negotiated unlimited
discounted AstroWorld tickets for you and your family in place of the
traditional "Enron Day At AstroWorld."  We hope this will allow Enron
families to plan their fun-filled summer trips to AstroWorld at their own
convenience.  Enron AstroWorld tickets are $20.56 (Retail $50), which
includes admission for one, plus a $7 meal ticket to one of five
restaurants
at AstroWorld.

Six Flags AstroWorld is a world-class family entertainment complex filled
with exciting rides and attractions, including 10 heart-pounding coasters,
over  40 blockbuster shows, interactive street entertainers and
star-studded
concerts.  Enron families will be able to purchase unlimited tickets for
use
anytime during the 2001 season.

Tickets will be on sale at Enron's Federal Credit Union, EB0399.  Visit the
credit union in person to make your purchases.  AstroWorld tickets will not
be mailed.  Enron employees who are not already Enron FCU members may pay
by
cash or money order only.  All Enron Employees are encouraged to take
advantage of this great summer fun deal and may purchase tickets through
August 30th.
