Wanted to give you brief feedback on our efforts to become the 1st Fortune
500 Company that has a 100% green headquarters.  We've established a
company-wide team and a working plan going forward, which includes:

1.  EES commodity team is going to run the numbers for energy commodity for
facilities and give them a proposal by end of next week.  While facilities
will not be part of the TX pilot, EES can arrange a financial deal for them
w/ an option of going physical on 1/1/02.   EES commodity team will also
let
the group know of the offer, in order to structure the REC deal.  Depending
upon the savings that EES can offer to Facilities, we will determine any
"headroom" for REC purchases.
Note: It is not necessary for Facilities to sign a commodity deal w/ EES in
order for the "greening" of the building to go forward.  The RECs can be
purchased and retired irrespective of the commodity deal with EES.
HOWEVER,
it would be optimum for Facilities to sign on w/ EES and use the cost
savings
toward purchase of the RECs.  Facilities stated intent to do the latter.
2. Michael Payne and Mike Curry are going to be working on determining a
cost
for the RECs.  Michael initially projected $250,000 per year for the
requisite number of RECs to retire commensurate w/ the demand of the
building.  This was at a cost of $8 per REC, which I believe is quite
high.
I think they'll go for a $1-4 dollar range, bringing the cost down to a max
of $125,000.  There's several ways to slice this end.  We can provide some
of
the RECs from the EWC facility and buy other RECs from the market in order
to
minimize the cost impact of the REC purchases.
3.  Next Thursday we will be able to get more of an exact figure on the
premium cost for the RECs (ie how much over the cost savings will the RECs
cost).  We will then need to decide the following:
 a. Would Corp/EHS being will to pitch in to cover any additional cost for
the RECs;
 b. Pitching the idea to Skilling for buyoff, and payment for the RECs;
 c. Possibly getting buyoff from the business units since this could change
what they are currently paying for power.
4. We discussed all of the above with Peggy Mahoney, and she asked us to
take
a stab at a comprehensive press release announcing all of the bells and
whistles on the new building and our being the 1st Fortune 500 company to
go
100% green in our headquarters.   Catherine McKalip Thompson is working on
the first draft.  We need to determine if we can get the "best" press for
this commitment (i.e. stories in the WSJ and NY Times).  We determined that
the message would need to be targeted, specifying the terms of our
commitment....i.e. Enron makes a commitment for 3 years to provide 100%
green
for its headquarters in Houston, making it the first Fortune 500 company
to.......

The goal is to have a final plan and decision by April 20th when Steve
speaks
to high level executives at a prelude to Earth Day NY on the topic of
Energy
Shock--Crisis or Opportunity: Building Economics and the Environment.

Mike, we'll definitely need your continued support and assistance,
particularly if this goes to Skilling.  I'll keep you posted on the
progress.

Stacey

You are invited to a meeting next Thursday (3/22) afternoon at 2:00 to
discuss energy commodity and renewable energy credits for the Enron
Building,
Center and Stadium.  There are a few efforts that are going on
simultaneously
and I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the
same page.  As many of you might know, Enron Wind (Michael Payne) and ENA
(Mike Curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from
our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and
stadium
(details attached below).  If this proposal goes forward, Enron would be
the
1st Fortune 500 company to "go green" in its headquarters building.  Couple
this w/ our energy star award, and we have GREAT environmental messaging.
We'd like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day (April 22nd).

The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for
actual commodity.  It makes sense to work strategically together on win-win
proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in
our messaging.  The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various
proposals,
and steps for moving forward.

The meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 2:00-3:00. Please let me know if you or
someone from your group can attend.
